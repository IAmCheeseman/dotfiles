# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

I use the JetBrains Nerd Font everywhere. Find it [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

My wallpaper is [here](https://github.com/whoisYoges/lwalpapers/blob/PicturesOnly/wallpapers/b-314.jpg).

## Neovim
Install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
Then run `:PackerSync`.

## Rofi
I didn't want to put Rofi here since it's just a minorly edited version of
someone else's theme.
If you want it, add it like so:
- Get the base theme [here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection),
it's the square material red.
- Change `accent-color` to #FF4499.
- Change `bg0` to #333333.
- Change `bg1` to #444444.
- Change `fg0` to #FFFFFF.
- Change `font` to `"JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Medium 12"`.

# Discord
Install better discord and move the theme into there.

# Spicetify
Install spicetify, and [this theme](https://github.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom).
Replace `color.ini` with `spicetify_bloom_colors.ini`.
