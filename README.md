# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Neovim needs Packer.

I use the JetBrains Nerd Font everywhere. Find it [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

My wallpaper is [here](https://github.com/whoisYoges/lwalpapers/blob/PicturesOnly/wallpapers/b-314.jpg).

## Rofi
I didn't want to put Rofi here since it's just a minorly edited version of someone else's theme.
If you want it, add it like so:
- Get the base theme [here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection), it's the square material red.
- Change `accent-color` to #FF4499.
- Change `bg0` to #333333.
- Change `bg1` to #444444.
- Change `fg0` to #FFFFFF.
