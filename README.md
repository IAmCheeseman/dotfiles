# Dotfiles
My dotfiles. There are some things in here specific to me, like how it launches
Discord and Thunderbird automatically. So if you want to steal these, you'll
have to find all that stuff and remove it yourself.

I use the JetBrainsMono Nerd Font everywhere. Find it [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## xborders
This config requires [xborders](https://github.com/deter0/xborder).
## Neovim
Install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
Then run `:PackerSync`.
## Rofi
I didn't want to put Rofi here since it's just a minorly edited version of
someone else's theme.
If you want it, add it like so:
- Get the base theme [here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection),
it's the square material red.
- Change `accent-color` to #E0E0E0.
- Change `bg0` to #222222.
- Change `bg1` to #333333.
- Change `fg0` to #FFFFFF.
- Change `font` to `"JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Medium 12"`.
